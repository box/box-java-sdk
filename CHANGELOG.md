## 2.22.0
- Deprecated the [moveFolderToUser()](https://github.com/box/box-java-sdk/blob/master/src/main/java/com/box/sdk/BoxUser.java#L455) for Box Users. We encourage users to
use [transferContent](https://github.com/box/box-java-sdk/blob/master/src/main/java/com/box/sdk/BoxUser.java#L482) going forward because idiomatically it is more correct.

## 2.1.0
