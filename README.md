Box Java SDK
============

The Box Java SDK for interacting with the
[Box Content API](https://developers.box.com/docs/).

Quickstart
----------

The SDK can be obtained by adding it as a [maven dependency]
(http://opensource.box.com/box-java-sdk/), cloning the source into your project,
or by downloading one of the precompiled JARs from the [releases page on GitHub]
(https://gitenterprise.inside-box.net/Box/box-java-sdk/releases).

If you use the JAR, you'll also need to include [minimal-json v0.9.1]
(https://github.com/ralfstx/minimal-json) - which is the SDK's only dependency.
You can get minimal-json from maven with `com.eclipsesource.minimal-json:minimal-json:0.9.1`.

Here is a simple example of how to authenticate with the API using a developer
token and then print the ID and name of each item in your root folder.

```java
BoxAPIConnection api = new BoxAPIConnection("developer-token");
BoxFolder rootFolder = BoxFolder.getRootFolder(api);
for (BoxItem.Info itemInfo : rootFolder) {
    System.out.format("[%d] %s\n", itemInfo.getID(), itemInfo.getName());
}
```

For more details on how to get started, check out the [overview
guide](doc/overview.md). It has a short explanation of how the SDK works and how
you can get started using it.

### Sample Project

A sample project can be found in `src/example`. This project will output your
name and a list of the files and folders in your root directory.

To run the project, first provide a developer token in
`src/example/java/com/box/sdk/example/Main.java`. You can obtain a developer
token from your application's [developer
console](https://cloud.app.box.com/developers/services).

```java
public final class Main {
    private static final String DEVELOPER_TOKEN = "<YOUR_DEVELOPER_TOKEN>";

    // ...
}
```

Then just invoke `gradle runExample` to run the example!

Building
--------

The SDK uses Gradle for its build system. Running `gradle build` from the root
of the repository will compile, lint, and test the SDK.

```bash
$ gradle build
```

The SDK also includes integration tests which make real API calls, and therefore
are run separately from unit tests. Integration tests should be run against a
test account since they create and delete data. To run the integration tests,
remove the `.template` extension from
`src/test/config/config.properties.template` and fill in your test account's
information. Then run:

```bash
$ gradle integrationTest
```

Documentation
-------------

You can find guides and tutorials in the `doc` directory.
