Box Java SDK
============

The Box Java SDK for interacting with the
[Box Content API](https://developers.box.com/docs/).

Quickstart
----------

The SDK can be obtained by adding it as a [maven dependency]
(http://opensource.box.com/box-java-sdk/), cloning the source into your project,
or by downloading one of the precompiled JARs from the [releases page on GitHub]
(https://github.com/box/box-java-sdk/releases).

If you use the JAR, you'll also need to include several dependencies:

1. [minimal-json v0.9.1](https://github.com/ralfstx/minimal-json)
   Maven: `com.eclipsesource.minimal-json:minimal-json:0.9.1`
2. [jose4j v0.4.4](https://bitbucket.org/b_c/jose4j/wiki/Home)
   Maven: `org.bitbucket.b_c:jose4j:0.4.4`
3. [bouncycastle bcprov-jdk15on v1.52](http://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.bouncycastle/bcprov-jdk15on)
   Maven: `org.bouncycastle:bcprov-jdk15on:1.52`
4. [bouncycastle bcpkix-jdk15on v1.52](http://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.bouncycastle/bcpkix-jdk15on)
   Maven: `org.bouncycastle:bcpkix-jdk15on:1.52`
5. [Java Cryptography Extension (JCE) Unlimited Strength Jurisdiction Policy Files 7](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jce-7-download-432124.html)
   If you don't install this, you'll get an exception about key length. This is not a Box thing, this is a U.S. Government requirement concerning strong encryption.

Here is a simple example of how to authenticate with the API using a developer
token and then print the ID and name of each item in your root folder.

```java
BoxAPIConnection api = new BoxAPIConnection("developer-token");
BoxFolder rootFolder = BoxFolder.getRootFolder(api);
for (BoxItem.Info itemInfo : rootFolder) {
    System.out.format("[%s] %s\n", itemInfo.getID(), itemInfo.getName());
}
```

For more details on how to get started, check out the [overview
guide](doc/overview.md). It has a short explanation of how the SDK works and how
you can get started using it.

### Sample Projects

Three sample projects can be found in `src/example`.

#### Main

This project will output your name and a list of the files and folders in your root directory.

To run the project, first provide a developer token in
`src/example/java/com/box/sdk/example/Main.java`. You can obtain a developer
token from your application's [developer
console](https://app.box.com/developers/services).

```java
public final class Main {
    private static final String DEVELOPER_TOKEN = "<YOUR_DEVELOPER_TOKEN>";

    // ...
}
```

Then just invoke `gradle runExample` to run the Main example!

#### CreateAppUser

This project will output the user id of enterprise admin and will create a new App User for the enterprise.

To run the project, first provide following in `src/example/java/com/box/sdk/example/CreateAppUser.java`.
* Client Id: From application's [developer console](https://app.box.com/developers/services).
* Client Secret: From application's [developer console](https://app.box.com/developers/services).
* Enterprise Id: From Admin Console [Account Info tab](https://app.box.com/master/settings).
* Public key Id: From application's [developer console](https://app.box.com/developers/services).
* Private key file name with path: Corresponding to the public key uploaded in application's [developer console](https://app.box.com/developers/services).
* Private key password (if any): Password for the private key.
* Name of App User: This will be used as the name of the newly created App User.

```java
public final class CreateAppUser {

    private static final String CLIENT_ID = "";
    private static final String CLIENT_SECRET = "";
    private static final String ENTERPRISE_ID = "";
    private static final String PUBLIC_KEY_ID = "";
    private static final String PRIVATE_KEY_FILE = "";
    private static final String PRIVATE_KEY_PASSWORD = "";
    private static final String APP_USER_NAME = "";

    // ...
}
```

Then just invoke `gradle runCreateAppUser` to run the CreateAppUser example!

Note: The JCE bundled with oracle JRE supports keys upto 128 bit length only. To use larger crytographic keys, install [JCE Unlimited Strength Jurisdiction Policy Files](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jce8-download-2133166.html).

#### AccessAsAppUser

This project will retrieve the information of the given App User and will list the files/folders under root folder.

To run the project, first provide following in `src/example/java/com/box/sdk/example/CreateAppUser.java`.
* Client Id: From application's [developer console](https://app.box.com/developers/services).
* Client Secret: From application's [developer console](https://app.box.com/developers/services).
* User Id: Id of the user whose data will be accessed.
* Public key Id: From application's [developer console](https://app.box.com/developers/services).
* Private key file name with path: Corresponding to the public key uploaded in application's [developer console](https://app.box.com/developers/services).
* Private key password (if any): Password for the private key.

```java
public final class AccessAsAppUser {

    private static final String CLIENT_ID = "";
    private static final String CLIENT_SECRET = "";
    private static final String USER_ID = "";
    private static final String PUBLIC_KEY_ID = "";
    private static final String PRIVATE_KEY_FILE = "";
    private static final String PRIVATE_KEY_PASSWORD = "";

    // ...
}
```

Then just invoke `gradle runAccessAsAppUser` to run the AccessAsAppUser example!

Note: The JCE bundled with oracle JRE supports keys upto 128 bit length only. To use larger cryptographic keys, install [JCE Unlimited Strength Jurisdiction Policy Files](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jce8-download-2133166.html).

Building
--------

The SDK uses Gradle for its build system. Running `gradle build` from the root
of the repository will compile, lint, and test the SDK.

```bash
$ gradle build
```

The SDK also includes integration tests which make real API calls, and therefore
are run separately from unit tests. Integration tests should be run against a
test account since they create and delete data. To run the integration tests,
remove the `.template` extension from
`src/test/config/config.properties.template` and fill in your test account's
information. Then run:

```bash
$ gradle integrationTest
```

Documentation
-------------

You can find guides and tutorials in the `doc` directory.
