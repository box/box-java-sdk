User Events
===========

The Box API provides an events endpoint that utilizes long-polling to send user events in real-time. The SDK provides an `EventStream` class that automatically handles long-polling and deduplicating events.

Listening to the EventStream
----------------------------

When the `EventStream` is started, it will begin long-polling on a separate thread. Events received from the API are then forwarded to any listeners.

```java
BoxAPIConnection api = new BoxAPIConnection("YOUR-DEVELOPER-TOKEN");
EventStream stream = new EventStream(api);
stream.addListener(new EventListener() {
    public void onEvent(BoxEvent event) {
        // Handle the event.
    }
});
stream.start();
```

Keep in mind that events are received on a separate thread, so things like UI operations may need to be explicitly delegated back to the UI thread.

When you're done listening for events, be sure to call `stream.stop()` to stop long-polling.

### Deduplicating Events

Since the Box API [may send duplicate events](https://developers.box.com/docs/#events), the `EventStream` will remember the last 512 received events and automatically ignore them.

Enterprise (Admin) Events
=========================

The Box API provides an `EventLog` class and a `getEnterpriseEvents` method that reads from the admin-logs streams and returns an `<iterable>` set of Enterprise `BoxEvent`s. 
There is no real-time, long polling integrace to Admin Events but you can specify start and end time/dates. This API call will only work with an auth token from an enterprise admin account.

```java
// get the last two hours of unfiltered enterprise events
BoxAPIConnection api = new BoxAPIConnection("");
Date startDate = new Date(System.currentTimeMillis() - (1000 * 60 * 60 * 2));
Date endDate = new Date(System.currentTimeMillis());
EventLog eventLog = EventLog.getEnterpriseEvents(api, startDate, endDate);
for (BoxEvent event : eventLog) {
    System.out.println("Enterprise Event Created by User: "
            + event.getCreatedBy().getName()
            + " Login: " + event.getCreatedBy().getLogin()
            + " Event Type: " + event.getType()
            + " Created at: " + event.getCreatedAt().toString());
};
```
