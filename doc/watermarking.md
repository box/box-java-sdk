Watermarking
======

The ability to watermark files and folders is represented as a sub-resource on the Files and Folders resources, respectively. You can think of the sub-resource as a "label" marking whether the file or folder is watermarked or not. If you apply a watermark label to a folder, then all files inside of it will be protected by the watermark (e.g. previews will be watermarked). However, those files' watermark sub-resource is independent from the folder that got watermarked. This allows you to watermark files and folders independently.
